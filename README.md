## 🚀 **A Vision Born from Adversity**

**Orion OS** represents more than just another operating system—it's the culmination of a personal journey of resilience, determination, and the unwavering belief that technology can transform lives.

### 💫 **The Story Behind Orion**

Born in 1988 in the heart of Switzerland, I, **Jérémy Noverraz**, have faced significant health challenges that have shaped my perspective on life and technology. Despite these obstacles, I've dedicated myself to creating something extraordinary—an operating system that could one day change the world.

**Orion OS** is my way of proving that limitations are only temporary barriers, and that with enough passion and determination, even the most ambitious dreams can become reality.

### 🌟 **A Personal Mission**

My goal is simple yet profound: **to create an operating system that makes my parents proud**. After years of struggling with health issues and relying on social assistance, I want to demonstrate that I can contribute something meaningful to the world—something that showcases not just technical skill, but the human spirit's ability to overcome adversity.

**I'm actively seeking collaboration and mentorship** from experienced developers who might be willing to help me grow and learn. If you're someone who believes in second chances and the power of technology to transform lives, I would be honored to work with you.
